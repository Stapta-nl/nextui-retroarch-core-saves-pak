#!/bin/sh
# Runs a list of collector commands and stores each one's output in a directory.
#
# Usage: collect.sh <list file> <output dir>
#
# The list has one collector per line: "<output file name> | <shell command>". Blank lines
# and lines starting with # are ignored. Adding something to collect is a one-line change
# in the list. A name ending in .gz is binary: its stderr goes to <name>.txt. A collector that fails never stops the others: its output (whatever it
# printed) is kept and its name and exit status go to collector-errors.txt.
# POSIX sh, so it also runs on the device's BusyBox. $SD is the SD card
# ($SDCARD_PATH, default /mnt/SDCARD) for commands that need it.
